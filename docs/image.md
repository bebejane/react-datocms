# `<Image/>` component for progressive/responsive images

`<Image />` is a React component specially designed to work seamlessly with DatoCMS’s [`responsiveImage` GraphQL query](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/uploads#responsive-images) that optimizes image loading for your sites.

- TypeScript ready;
- CSS-in-JS ready;
- Usable both client and server side;
- Compatible with vanilla React, Next.js and pretty much any other React-based solution;

## Out-of-the-box features

- Offers optimized version of images for browsers that support WebP/AVIF format
- Generates multiple smaller images so smartphones and tablets don’t download desktop-sized images
- Efficiently lazy loads images to speed initial page load and save bandwidth
- Holds the image position so your page doesn’t jump while images load
- Uses either blur-up or background color techniques to show a preview of the image while it loads

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-datocms
```

## Intersection Observer

Intersection Observer is the API used to determine if the image is inside the viewport or not. [Browser support is really good](https://caniuse.com/intersectionobserver) - With Safari adding support in 12.1, all major browsers now support Intersection Observers natively.

If the IntersectionObserver object is not available, the component treats the image as it's always visible in the viewport. Feel free to add a [polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intersection-observer) so that it will also 100% work on older versions of iOS and IE11.

## Usage

1. Import `Image` from `react-datocms` and use it in place of the regular `<img />` tag
2. Write a GraphQL query to your DatoCMS project using the [`responsiveImage` query](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/images-and-videos#responsive-images)

The GraphQL query returns multiple thumbnails with optimized compression. The `Image` component automatically sets up the “blur-up” effect as well as lazy loading of images further down the screen.

## Example

For a fully working example take a look at our [examples directory](https://github.com/datocms/react-datocms/tree/master/examples).

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Image } from 'react-datocms';

const Page = ({ data }) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{data.blogPost.title}</h1>
    <Image data={data.blogPost.cover.responsiveImage} />
  </div>
);

const query = gql`
  query {
    blogPost {
      title
      cover {
        responsiveImage(
          imgixParams: { fit: crop, w: 300, h: 300, auto: format }
        ) {
          # always required
          src
          width
          height

          # not required, but strongly suggested!
          alt
          title

          # blur-up placeholder, JPEG format, base64-encoded, or...
          base64
          # background color placeholder
          bgColor

          # you can omit `sizes` if you explicitly pass the `sizes` prop to the image component
          sizes
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

export default withQuery(query)(Page);
```

### Layout mode

With the `layout` property, you can configure the behavior of the image as the viewport changes size:

- When `intrinsic` (default behaviour), the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller viewports, but maintain the original dimensions for larger viewports.
- When `fixed`, the image dimensions will not change as the viewport changes (no responsiveness) similar to the native `img` element.
- When `responsive`, the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller viewports and scale up for larger viewports.
- When `fill`, the image will stretch both width and height to the dimensions of the parent element, provided the parent element is relative.
  - This is usually paired with the `objectFit` and `objectPosition` properties.
  - Ensure the parent element has `position: relative` in their stylesheet.

Example for `layout="fill"` (useful also for background images):

```jsx
<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: 200, height: 500 }}>
  <Image
    data={imageData}
    layout="fill"
    objectFit="cover"
    objectPosition="50% 50%"
  />
</div>
```

### The `ResponsiveImage` object

The `data` prop expects an object with the same shape as the one returned by `responsiveImage` GraphQL call. It's up to you to make a GraphQL query that will return the properties you need for a specific use of the `<Image>` component.

- The minimum required properties for `data` are: `src`, `width` and `height`;
- `alt` and `title`, while not mandatory, are all highly suggested, so remember to use them!
- If you don't request `srcSet`, the component will auto-generate an `srcset` based on `src` + the `srcSetCandidates` prop (it can help reducing the GraphQL response size drammatically when many images are returned);
- We strongly to suggest to always specify [`{ auto: format }`](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/rendering/auto/auto#format) in your `imgixParams`, instead of requesting `webpSrcSet`, so that you can also take advantage of more performant optimizations (AVIF), without increasing GraphQL response size;
- If you request both the `bgColor` and `base64` property, the latter will take precedence, so just avoid querying both fields at the same time, as it will only make the GraphQL response bigger :wink:;
- You can avoid requesting `sizes` and directly pass a `sizes` prop to the component to reduce the GraphQL response size;

Here's a complete recap of what `responsiveImage` offers:
